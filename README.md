# ethereum-wallet-decrypter
A proof-of-concept project to show how cryptocurrency wallets are not as secure as you would think.

One of the key features of cryptocurrency is that you officialy own the crypto locked behind a secure wallet no one can hack into. This wallet is not very secure because the only thing protecting is a string of characters. This program is meant to show how that if you have a computer go on a repeated loop generating wallets until the public key matches, you can discover someone's private key.
